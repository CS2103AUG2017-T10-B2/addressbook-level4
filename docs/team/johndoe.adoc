=== Enhancement Added: Undo/Redo

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=addphoto]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
The option to add a photo to a contact is a much needed feature that gives users more details pertaining to that individual contact. In addition to a chunk of words, users are more visually impacted from visual cues like photos and it gives a more wholesome description of a contact inside PEERSONAL.


==== Implementation
